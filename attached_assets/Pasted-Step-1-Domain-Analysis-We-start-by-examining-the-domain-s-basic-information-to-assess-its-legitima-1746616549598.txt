Step 1: Domain Analysis
We start by examining the domain's basic information to assess its legitimacy.

Verify the domain's age (newer domains are higher risk)
Check registration and expiration dates
Analyze domain name for suspicious patterns
Compare against known brand impersonations
Step 2: WHOIS Data Verification
We check the domain's WHOIS information to verify ownership and registration details.

Validate registrar information
Check for privacy protection services
Analyze registrant country and organization
Check consistency of registration information
Step 3: IP Address & Server Analysis
We analyze the website's hosting infrastructure to identify potential risks.

Check IP reputation and location
Verify nameserver configuration
Detect proxy or VPN usage

Step 4: SSL & Security Implementation
We check the website's security measures to ensure your data is protected.

Verify SSL certificate validity

Step 5: Blacklist & Reputation Check
We verify if the website has been reported for malicious activity.

Cross-check against malware databases
Check phishing detection systems
Analyze user reports and feedback
Check multiple security blacklists
Final Step: Trust Score Calculation
We compile all analysis data to generate a comprehensive trust score and assessment.
